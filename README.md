# Deployable_AzureFunction-VB_64bit_FW4.8
VB.NET solution, equivalent to C# sample HttpTrigger Azure function produced by VS 2019 (Framework 4.8)

Should work with VS 2015 and up. Maybe even previous versions.

Note:
This project will download nearly 400MB of libraries needed for compilation (C# sample project downloads only 70MB, maybe some libraries could be removed), but it compiles and publishes no more than 20kB of app content.
