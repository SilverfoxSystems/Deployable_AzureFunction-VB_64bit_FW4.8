# Deployable Azure Function (VB 64bit FW4.8)
VB.NET solution, equivalent to C# sample HttpTrigger Azure function produced by VS 2019 (Framework 4.8)

Should work with VS 2015 and up. Maybe even previous versions.

Note:
This project will download nearly 400MB of libraries needed for compilation (C# sample project downloads only 70MB, maybe some libraries could be removed), but will compile and publish no more than 20kB of app content.


For VS Community edition, download and install the VS template from [the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SilverfoxSystems0.FunctionAppVbFwHttpTrigger1).

 Packages for VS Pro and Enterprise editions can be ordered [here](http://silverfox.systems/OrderVSIX.aspx).
